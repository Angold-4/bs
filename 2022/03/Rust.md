# The Rust Programming Language

## 1. Why Rust? 

#### "Safe System Performance Programming"

* **System Programming Language:** _C, C++_.
* **Safe Programming Language:** _ML, Haskell, Java_

**Mozilla trying to blend the best of both of these languages**.

#### Why is Mozilla interested in creating a new programming language?
* Mozilla is the organization that created the Firefox web browser, current written in _C++_.
* **Web browsers need a high degree of control over the machine**.
    * Doing very complex tasks very quickly (all these tabs running simultaneously)
* **Web browsers need safety**
    * Running untrusted code, which is been downloaded from internet.
* **Languages like _C/C++_ that give you the kind of control you need in order to get the performance, but also leave you open to all kinds of security vulnerabilities.**
* Mozilla want to build the next generation web browser, which is a project called _[servo](https://github.com/servo/servo)_. And they wants to do it in a new language that tries to do better at giving you both **control** and **safety** at the same time.


## 2. Control



## 3. Safety
