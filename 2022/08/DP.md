# Dynamic Programming

* **Dynamic Programming Hallmark #1**: **The Optimal Structure:** 
    * An optimal solution to a problem (instance), contains optimal solutions to subproblems.
* **Dynamic Programming Hallmark #2**: **Overlapping Subproblems:**
    * A recursive solution contains a small number of distinct subproblmes, repeated many times.

**Dynamic Programming -- A Buttom-up approach.**
